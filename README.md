# Account and Payment Management System

**Description:**

This C++ code defines two essential classes, `Account` and `Payment`, which are designed to manage user account details and payment information in a software system. 

**Account Class:**
- Represents user accounts.
- Stores account ID, status, and password.
- Provides methods for displaying and editing account details.

**Payment Class:**
- Represents payment information.
- Stores payment ID, method, amount, and date.
- Provides methods for displaying payment details and checking payment history.

**Usage:**
- These classes serve as foundational components for managing user accounts and payment records in a larger software system, such as a membership or payment processing application.

**Contributing:**
- You can extend and enhance these classes with additional features and functionalities, making them more versatile and applicable to a wider range of software projects.

**Note:**
- The code references additional entities like `Fine`, which are not defined in the code snippet. You may need to include the definition of `Fine` if it is a part of your system.
